\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

In this section outline your results. At this point, you are just stating the outcome of your analysis. You can highlight important aspects (``we observe a significantly higher value of $x$ over $y$''), but leave interpretation and opinion to the next section. This section absoultely \emph{must} include at least two figures.

        Behavioral adaptation across borrowing sessions.
        Late-return probability is shown as a smoothed trajectory with point markers
        (\textcolor{TUblue}{\tikz\draw[line width=0.8pt] (0,0) -- (0.9em,0)
        node[midway, above=0.15em, circle, fill=TUblue, inner sep=0.35pt] {};}),
        with uncertainty indicated by a shaded confidence band
        (\textcolor{TUblue!40}{\tikz\draw[fill=TUblue!40, draw=none] (0,0) rectangle (0.9em,0.7em);}).
        Extension probability is shown as a dashed trajectory with point markers
        (\textcolor{pn_orange}{\tikz\draw[dashed, line width=0.8pt] (0,0) -- (0.9em,0)
        node[midway, above=0.15em, circle, fill=TUorange, inner sep=0.35pt] {}; }).
        Late-return probability corresponds to the left y-axis, extension probability to the right y-axis.
