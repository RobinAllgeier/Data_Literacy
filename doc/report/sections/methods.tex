\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

%In this section, describe \emph{what you did}. Roughly speaking, explain what data you worked with, how or from where it was collected, it's structure and size. Explain your analysis, and any specific choices you made in it. Depending on the nature of your project, you may focus more or less on certain aspects. If you collected data yourself, explain the collection process in detail. If you downloaded data from the net, show an exploratory analysis that builds intuition for the data, and shows that you know the data well. If you are doing a custom analysis, explain how it works and why it is the right choice. If you are using a standard tool, it may still help to briefly outline it. Cite relevant works. You can use the \verb|\citep| and \verb|\citet| commands for this purpose \citep{mackay2003information}.

\subsection{Data Collection and Description}
This study investigates the borrowing behavior of users at the Tübingen City Library, as well as the frequency of late returns. The dataset was provided directly by the Tübingen City Library and covers borrowing records from 2019 to 2025. It encompasses over 2.4 million individual loan transactions and includes the following key variables: borrowing and return timestamps, 21 different media types, user categories, number of extensions, anonymized user identification numbers, as well as late return flags. Each record documents a complete transaction from initial borrowing to return.
Domain knowledge was gathered through a personal interview with a staff member of the Tübingen City Library, providing contextual insights into the data collection processes, library operations, and data quality practices. Additional information was obtained through ongoing email communication with the library staff, which helped to clarify data inconsistencies and provide domain expertise for informed analysis decisions.

\subsection{Data Quality Assessment: Sanity Checks}
Prior to conducting any analysis, a comprehensive set of data quality checks were preformed to validate internal consistency and identify potential data quality issues. The following checks were implemented:
\textbf{Missing Values:} The proportion of missing values was assessed for each column. Retrun timestamps were missing in apporximately 2\% of rows, which is expected for currently borrowed or lost items and therefore retained. User IDs showed a missing rate of 6.7\%, which was handled accordingly in subsequent analyses. All other relevant columns had such low missing rates, that they were considered negligible.
\textbf{Temporal Consistency:} The integrity of temporal data was verified by checking for logical inconsistencies, such as rerurn dates preceding borrowing dates and a correct calculation of duration values from the timestamps.
\textbf{Late Return Consistency:} The consistency between late return flags and the number of days late was validated. Additionally, implausible values in the extensions column were checked. Only a few cases with more than six extentions were identified (0.003\%), which  but were not further investugated due to their negligible impact.
\textbf{Duplicate Analysis:} Various forms of duplicates were examined. No exact duplicates were found, but identical borrowing timestamps occurred when useres borrowed multiple items in one transaction, with a maximum of seven items per transaction. These were retained as they represent valid borrowing behavior.

\subsection{Data cleaning}
Based on the result of the data quality assessment, the data was cleaned, based on four rules. The following entries were removed from the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entries with missing return timestamps, as they represent currently borrowed or lost items.
    \item Entries with a borrowing time longer than the 196 days, because they extend the maximum borrowing period of 28 days and six extentions, which are considered implausible.
    \item Borrowings taken by library’s staff members and system entries, which do not reflect typical user behavior.
    \item For some analyses, only books were considered, because other media types have different borrowing duration limits and would distort the results.
    \item For analyses comparing media types, media types with fewer than a minimum number of entries were excluded to reduce the influence of sparsely represented categories.


\end{itemize}
These cleaning steps ensured that the dataset used for analysis was both reliable and relevant, thereby enhancing the validity of the findings.


\subsection{Analysis Methods}

To shift from item-level borrowing records to user-level behavioral analysis, individual borrowings were aggregated into user-specific sessions. 
Each record represents a single item, whereas users typically borrow multiple items in a single library visit. 
We thus define a session as all borrowings by the same user on the same calendar day. 
Sessions were ordered chronologically per user and assigned a session index as a proxy for accumulating experience. 
Session-level indicators were derived via aggregation. 
A session was classified as \emph{late} if \emph{any} item was returned after its due date, and as \emph{extended} if \emph{any} item received a loan extension. 
This conservative threshold marks the session according to the user's behavior at that experience level. 
Even one late return or extension shows their actions linked to that session. 
This session-based representation provides the foundation for all subsequent analyses.

Behavioral adaptation over time was examined using the session index as a proxy for user experience. 
For each experience level $k$, we computed the proportion of late sessions and sessions with extensions across all users who reached at least $k$ sessions, ensuring each user contributes at most one observation per level. 
Let $L_{u,k}$ indicate whether the $k$-th session of user $u$ contains at least one late item. 
The late-return learning curve is then
\[
\hat{p}_{L}(k) = \frac{1}{|U_k|} \sum_{u \in U_k} L_{u,k},
\]
where $U_k$ is the set of users with at least $k$ sessions. 
The extension curve was computed analogously.

Uncertainty was quantified via user-level bootstrap resampling. 
Given the dependence of observations within users and the unknown sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_L(k)$, parametric methods are unsuitable. 
We thus resampled users with replacement, reconstructed their session sequences, and recomputed the learning curves for each bootstrap sample. 
Confidence intervals were derived from the empirical distributions of these estimates~\cite{Davison_Hinkley_1997}.
