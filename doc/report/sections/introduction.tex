Outline the rest of the paper (use references, e.g.~to \Cref{sec:methods}: What kind of data you are working with, how you analyse it, and what kind of conclusion you reached.

Public libraries serve a critical role in democratic societies by providing equal access to knowledge, education, and cultural resources.
Understanding user borrowing behavior enables libraries to improve service quality and ensure materials remain available to all.
This study analyzes borrowing records from the Tübingen City Library, addressing questions identified in collaboration with library staff to support evidence-based decision-making.

A central operational challenge is the timely return of borrowed materials.
Late returns disrupt circulation efficiency: when items remain overdue, they are marked as on-loan in the system but are neither available for other patrons nor counted as part of the accessible collection.
In severe cases, overdue items can escalate to multiple reminders and eventually legal action to recover replacement costs, straining administrative resources.
Studies of academic library circulation demonstrate that return behavior is shaped by multiple factors including users characteristics, reminders, and institutional policies~\cite{library_fines_return}.

Beyond late returns, understanding broader borrowing patterns such as temporal regularities, learning effects, and media preferences enables data-driven policy decisions.
This analysis leverages over 2.4 million transactions from 2019 to 2025 to examine engagement over time.
We develop a session-based analytical framework (\Cref{sec:methods}) that aggregates item-level records into user visits.
Our analysis (\Cref{sec:results}) reveals distinct temporal usage patterns tied to operating hours and shows that late returns decline over initial sessions while extension requests increase.
Section~\Cref{sec:conclusion} discusses how these findings inform library operations and policy.
