% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2023

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section*{Contribution Statement}
Nico Rinck analyzed media types in relation to user behavior. Jonas Mahr examined users’ interest categories. Adriano Polzer analyzed user behavior with respect to time of day. Robin Allgeier obtained the data and prepared it through sanity checks and data cleaning. Jannik Rombach prepared the data and analyzed users’ learning behavior.

%\section*{Notes}
%Your entire report has a \textbf{hard page limit of 4 pages} excluding references and the contribution statement. (I.e. any pages beyond page 4 must only contain the contribution statement and references). Appendices are \emph{not} possible. But you can put additional material, like interactive visualizations or videos, on a githunb repo (use \href{https://github.com/pnkraemer/tueplots}{links} in your pdf to refer to them). Each report has to contain \textbf{at least three plots or visualizations}, and \textbf{cite at least two references}. More details about how to prepare the report, inclucing how to produce plots, cite correctly, and how to ideally structure your github repo, will be discussed in the lecture, where a rubric for the evaluation will also be provided.
